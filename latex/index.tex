This library uses the data in jmatrix format, a specific library of matrix manipulation that allows extremely big matrices (as long as the RAM of the machine allows).~\newline
Apart from the PAM itself the library also implements in parallel the calculation of the distance/dissimilarity matrix (metrics L1 and L2 and Pearson dissimilarity) and the silhouette of the resulting clustering.~\newline
~\newline
It includes four example programs (see section Files below)\+:~\newline
~\newline
{\bfseries{pardis}}\+: Parallel calculation of distance/dissimilarity matrix from a jmatrix with data~\newline
{\bfseries{parpam}}\+: Parallel implementation of the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm from a distance matrix.~\newline
{\bfseries{parsil}}\+: Parallel calculation of the silhouette of each points after the clustering has been applied.~\newline
{\bfseries{tdvalue}}\+: Calculation of the value of the optimization function of the PAM algorithm for a given clusterization result.~\newline
~\newline
These library uses the library jmatlib (see \href{https://github.com/JdMDE/jmatlib}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Jd\+MDE/jmatlib}}) which therefore needs to be installed before compilation and use of ppamlib.~\newline
~\newline
The code of this library with interface modifications is also used inside the parallelpam R package (\href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=parallelpam}{\texttt{ https\+://\+CRAN.\+R-\/project.\+org/package=parallelpam}}) and inside the scellpam package (\href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=scellpam}{\texttt{ https\+://\+CRAN.\+R-\/project.\+org/package=scellpam}})
